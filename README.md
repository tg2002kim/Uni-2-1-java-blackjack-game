Black Jack game


This project was developed during the first semester of my second year (2024) as part of a Java Programming course assignment at university.

It is a simple Blackjack card game implemented using Java and the Swing GUI toolkit. The project aims to reinforce understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP), event-driven design, and GUI development in Java.

Key features include a betting system, win/loss tracking, and a user-friendly interface. The game allows players to compete against a dealer using standard Blackjack rules, including actions like hit, stay, and bust detection. The betting system requires the player to place a wager before each round, and results are reflected in both money and win rate updates.

Additional functionalities include automatic tracking of wins, losses, and ties, real-time win rate calculation, and visual feedback for game status (e.g., game over, not enough money). Although a multiplayer mode was considered, it was excluded due to gameplay constraints and the nature of Blackjack being inherently one-on-one.

The program structure demonstrates modular class design with core components such as `Card`, `BlackJack`, and GUI controllers. Techniques like random deck shuffling, dynamic event handling via anonymous inner classes, and card image rendering were utilized.

Throughout the development process, particular attention was given to gameplay logic accuracy and rule compliance. Several revisions were made to resolve issues such as incorrect win-rate calculations and betting logic. These iterations significantly improved the reliability and realism of the game.

This project not only served as a hands-on exercise in Java GUI programming, but also provided practical experience in debugging, incremental design, and implementing user-centric interactions in a graphical application.
